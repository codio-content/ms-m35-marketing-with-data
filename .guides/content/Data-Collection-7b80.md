## Who collects data and how?

Data is collected on everyone almost all of the time. Before the internet, data collection companies paid attention to things like how many people live in a house, how old they are, what kinds of magazines they subscribe to, and what kind of cars they buy.

Now, in addition to that data, they can collect information on our likes, dislikes, lifestyles, age, job, and people we hang out with all from our social media profiles. If you have ever wondered how Facebook earns money, it is because a lot of companies are willing to pay money for descriptive information that is on Facebook profiles. Data collection also occurs when we make online purchases and even visit websites.

All of this information is gathered together to create a profile of each person and determine what other people they are similar to. Similarities are used to categorize people.
