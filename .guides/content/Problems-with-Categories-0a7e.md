There are some problems with categorizing people in this way. 

- By targeting only certain people, a company may miss many potential customers because they did not account for their group.

- If the data stored for a person or household is out of date or incorrect, the person who would otherwise be interested could be missed -- or selected for marketing of an item they won't be interested in at all.

- Sometimes, people act differently than the group they are a part of, so their interests cannot be predicted based on their categories.
