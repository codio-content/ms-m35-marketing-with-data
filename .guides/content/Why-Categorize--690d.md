The main reason companies group people into categories is **targeted marketing**. This means that rather than spend a lot of money sending mail to everyone, for example, a company can choose those who are most likely to want a specific product and only send them mail about that product. This saves the company money and keeps people from being flooded by advertisements that they would not be interested in.
